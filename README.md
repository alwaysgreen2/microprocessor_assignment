# Microprocessor_Assignment

## Software 
- Logisim Evolved 
## Introduction 
We tried to implement a 4-bit microprocessar which would be the simplification of 32-bit MIPS architecture given in the book
'Computer Organization and design By David Patterson'. 
## Specifications
- Intructions
- `Load`
- `Add`
- `Subtract`
- `Increment`
- `Decrement` 
- how many executable
- `Load & Store`
- clock frequency 
- `1.0Hz`
- Registers
- `4`
- Register File used as RAM
- Architecture 
- `Von Neumann`

## Circuit Diagram 

## Conclusion 
We learned from this assignment how to design a 4 bit microprocessar which can execute upto 5 instructions and we also learned the basic techniques of using a github repository such as pull,commit,branch etc,we also learned how to collaborate with each member using github.
